The Dealmaker is an automated negotiation agent designed and implemented specifically for the Automated Negotiation League (ANL) 2024.  The primary objective of The Dealmaker is to negotiate bilaterally with
other agents efficiently, aiming to maximize its individual utility without knowledge
of its opponentâ€™s reservation value. We leverage concepts from game theory
and negotiation strategy to develop The Dealmaker as a competitive participant
in the ANL.
